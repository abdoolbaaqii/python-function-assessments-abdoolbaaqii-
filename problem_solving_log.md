## ROADBLOCKS & BREAKTHROUGHS
### The hardest questions
- Question 4
- Question 6
- Question 7


### How I solve them
- As for question 4; since I am not familiar with a function that count and split words in a sentences, I made my research on that, and I come to learn about the split() function. I also look through examples which guide me in solving the question.
- Question 6; chalenges overcome here is also the same as the one in question 4, I also made research on that, and I was able to overcome the challenges.
- Question 7; this was my hardest question in all, I was able to overcome it mathematically, I solved it in a piece of paper; mathematically, and it was easy this way.


### Time spends on each question
- Question 1: 3 minutes
- Question 2: 5 minutes
- Question 3: 2 minutes
- Question 4: 19 minutes
- Question 5: 8 minutes
- Question 6: 14 minutes
- Question 7: 26 minutes
- Question 8: 10 minutes
- Question 9: 10 minutes

### What I would work on if there is another chance
- I would work on how to write a function involving word problem, which is question 7.
